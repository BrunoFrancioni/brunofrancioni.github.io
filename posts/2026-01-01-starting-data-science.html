  <main>
    <p>After almost five years of being a software engineer, I decided to make a huge change by buying and starting to do a Data Science and Machine Learning course. It’s not an idea that I had a few months ago, I had been thinking about it for a couple of years. In fact, I started to study those technologies a couple of years ago, but then I stopped. It wasn’t the time.</p>

    <p>Something inside of me always said that I liked the part of managing data. I don’t like making design decisions, choosing a color, how to show things, etc. I always liked more backend tasks and system design decisions. After finishing this course, I can confirm that that feeling was always correct. I really like the universe of possibilities that working with data gives you in terms of decisions. I also link businesses, so being able to see how data science can help me make decisions to improve or change something in business is really powerful.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, I realized that I was going to enjoy what I was going to learn. Of course that I think that buying the right course also helped with the learning experience. Seeing the potential of Pandas and Numpy, combined with Matplotlib in order to visualize data characteristics, helped me to understand the potential of the process.</p>

  <p>Also, the fact that I really liked is having the opportunity to use machine learning algorithms. I had zero knowledge about all of that world and it really surprised me. I want to keep practicing with examples and go deeper in the math background that this technology has.</p>

  <p>Now it’s time to start with TensorFlow and deep learning, so let’s see what it has for me.</p>
